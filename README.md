# Linear-Regression-Analysis
I have a file including 6 different data sets. For each data set in the file, I will create a scatter plot and visually decide if a linear model is appropriat or not. If the relation is not linear, I try to transform the data accordingly. I will consider trying logarithm, exponential, square root, square, etc., for X and/or Y until we see a linear relation. Then, I'll create an OLS model for the original and transformed data if required, and will evaluate if the OLS assumptions are met: normality of errors centered around zero, equal variance, etc..., for the original data and transformed data if appropriate. We will see how the transformation impacted the different assumptions. (This should be done only by looking at the output diagnostic charts created by the software). Also, if datasets have outliers, I'll remove the outliers and see the effect in the model (slope, intercept and R-square).
